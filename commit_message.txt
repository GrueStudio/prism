feat(task): Implement basic task navigation commands

This commit implements the initial set of task navigation commands: `start`, `done`, and `next`.
It also introduces a cursor mechanism to track the current action and refactors the underlying `Tracker` logic to support this new functionality.

Key changes include:
- Added a `cursor` field to the `ProjectData` model to persist the current task.
- Implemented `get_item_path` in `Tracker` for reliable item path retrieval.
- Implemented `get_current_action`, `start_next_action`, and `complete_current_action` methods in `Tracker` to manage task states and cursor movement.
- Created the `prism task` command group with `start`, `done`, and `next` subcommands.
- Registered the `task` command group in `prism/cli.py`.
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all `task` commands and their interactions.
