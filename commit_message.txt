fix(task): Correct task skipping and improve 'start' command behavior

This commit fixes an issue where the `prism task start` command would sometimes appear to skip tasks.
The `start_next_action` method in `prism/tracker.py` was refined to prioritize returning an already in-progress task, and only then search for the next pending task.
Additionally, the `start_next_action` method was incorrectly nested within another method, causing an `AttributeError`. This has been corrected.

Key changes include:
- Refactored `start_next_action` in `prism/tracker.py` to correctly identify and return an existing in-progress task, or find the next pending task if none is active.
- Corrected the accidental nesting of `start_next_action` and `complete_current_action` methods in `prism/tracker.py`, making them top-level methods of the `Tracker` class.
- Updated the `start` command in `prism/commands/task.py` to provide appropriate feedback when a task is already in progress.
