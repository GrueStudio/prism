feat: Implement .prism/ folder-based storage with lazy-loading archives

MIGRATION SYSTEM
- Add migration script (scripts/migrate_project.py) to convert project.json
- Generate UUIDs for all items during migration
- Transform nested structure to flat structure with parent_uuid references
- Separate active vs archived items:
  - strategic.json: Current phase/milestone/objective path only
  - execution.json: Active deliverables and actions
  - archive/strategic.json: Archived items grouped by type
  - archive/{uuid}.exec.json: Archived execution trees per objective
- Create config.json with default values from constants.py
- Backup project.json before migration
- Add index tracking (phase_index, milestone_index, objective_index) for path resolution
- Preserve item order using child_uuids field

DATA MODELS
- Add child_uuids field to BaseItem for order preservation
- Phase/Milestone/Objective/Deliverable track children via child_uuids
- All items have UUID for reliable lookups
- Move all models to prism/models/base.py to avoid circular imports
- Add ArchivedItem lazy-loading wrapper (prism/models/archived.py)
- Add Project dataclass (prism/models/project.py)
- Consolidate archive functionality into ArchiveManager

ARCHIVE MANAGER
- Merge AutoArchiveListener into ArchiveManager (prism/managers/archive_manager.py)
- ArchivedItem wrapper with lazy loading and position tracking
- Supports nested children loading with order preservation
- Auto-archive on item completion via EventBus
- Type inference from parent_uuid relationship

CLI COMMANDS (NEW STORAGE)
- Add prism crud command group (unified CRUD for all item types)
  - Path is positional argument: `crud show 1/2/1`
  - UUID lookup with -u flag: `crud show -u <uuid>`
  - Single-letter options: -t (type), -n (name), -d (desc), -s (status), -j (json), -p (parent-path)
- Add prism task commands (start/done/next)
- Add prism status command with JSON output
- Add prism config command group (stubs)
- Add prism orphan command group (stubs)

DEPRECATED CODE (with warnings)
- prism/cli_old.py - Old CLI using project.json
- prism/core_old.py - Old Core using project.json
- prism/models_old.py - Old models using project.json
- prism/data_store_old.py - Old DataStore using project.json
- prism/navigator_old.py - Old Navigator using project.json
- prism/commands/strat_old.py - Old strat commands
- prism/commands/exec_old.py - Old exec commands
- prism/commands/status_old.py - Old status command
- prism/commands/task_old.py - Old task commands

BUG FIXES
- Set parent_uuid when adding items (critical for archive type inference)
- Fix ArchivedItem type inference from parent_uuid relationship
- Fix archive file naming ({uuid}.exec.json instead of objective-{uuid}.exec.json)
- Fix test imports to use explicit model imports from prism.models.base

TESTING
- 176 tests pass
- Add tests/test_new_cli.py with 25 tests for new CLI commands
- Update test_storage_manager.py for new archive structure
- Fix test_auto_archive.py for new archive format
- Mock-based tests don't touch actual files
