# Bugs

This file tracks bugs and issues for the Prism CLI.

---
## Known Bugs:

* Parents completion not cascading (Issue #1): When all child items of a parent are marked as complete, the parent is not automatically marked as complete. This affects the task progression system where completing all actions in a deliverable should mark the deliverable as complete and move to the next deliverable.

## Fixed Bugs:

* None currently.
